This paper focuses on resource allocation in mobile robots that have resource constraints. We use the robot's context -- determined by its sensors -- to dynamically adjust the scheduling priority of its tasks. The demo in this video shows a combination of SLAM, command recongition, and matrix multiplication tasks. The two graphs show the task priorities. The top graph shows the absolute priority of the running task. The bottom graph shows the CPU allocation percent for that task.

SLAM is configured to have very high priority when we detect motion using the accelrometer. The command recongition is configured to have high priority when we detect audio input. We see the SLAM priority is much higher than the rest because in the current context, the robot is constantly moving.
